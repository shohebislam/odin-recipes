    <p>This recipe is a family favorite that was passed down over the generations. Grandma and Pap just ate them plain, with a fork (sometimes dipped in ketchup), but our family likes to top these burgers with cheese and serve on a hamburger bun in a the traditional way. I have also seen these referred to as Kotlety Mielone. These can also be cooked on the grill.    </p>
    <h2>Ingrediants:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef        </li>
        <li>1 small onion, diced        </li>
        <li>½ green pepper, diced        </li>
        <li>1 egg </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon sea salt </li>
        <li>2 slices white bread, torn into small pieces        </li>
        <li>1 serving cooking spray with olive oil        </li>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>Mix ground beef, onion, green pepper, egg, ketchup, and sea salt together in a bowl; mix in the white bread pieces until evenly distributed. Form the mixture into 4 patties.
        </li> 
        <li>Spray a large skillet with olive oil cooking spray and set over medium heat. Cook the burgers until well-browned on the bottoms, about 10 minutes; flip the burgers and cook until the meat is no longer pink and the juices run clear, 8 to 10 more minutes.
        </li>
        </ol>

    </ul>
